# addressit

AddressIt is a freeform street address parser, that is designed to take a
piece of text and convert that into a structured address that can be
processed in different systems.

The focal point of `addressit` is on the street parsing component, rather
than attempting to appropriately identify various states, counties, towns,
etc, as these vary from country to country fairly dramatically. These
details are instead put into a generic regions array that can be further
parsed based on your application needs.

## Example Usage

The following is a simple example of how address it can be used:

```js
const addressit = require('addressit');

// parse a made up address, with some slightly tricky parts
const address = addressit('Shop 8, 431 St Kilda Rd Melbourne');

// now log that address to the console
console.log(address)
```

The `address` object would now contain the following information:

```
{ text: '8/431 ST KILDA RD MELBOURNE',
  parts: [],
  unit: 8,
  country: undefined,
  number: 431,
  street: 'ST KILDA RD',
  regions: [ 'MELBOURNE' ] }
```

For more examples, see the tests.

## Reference

### addressit(input, opts?)

Run the address parser for the given input.  Optional `opts` can be
supplied if you want to override the default (EN) parser.

### Address

#### Address#_extractStreetParts(startIndex)

This function is used to extract from the street type match
index *back to* the street number and possibly unit number fields.

The function will start with the street type, then also grab the previous
field regardless of checks.  Fields will continue to be pulled in until
fields start satisfying numeric checks.  Once positive numeric checks are
firing, those will be brought in as building / unit numbers and once the
start of the parts array is reached or we fall back to non-numeric fields
then the extraction is stopped.

#### Address#clean

The clean function is used to clean up an address string.  It is designed
to remove any parts of the text that preven effective parsing of the
address string.

#### Address#extract(fieldName, regexes)

The extract function is used to extract the specified field from the raw
parts that have previously been split from the input text.  If successfully
located then the field will be updated from the parts and that part removed
from the parts list.

#### Address#extractStreet

This function is used to parse the address parts and locate any parts
that look to be related to a street address.

#### Address#finalize

The finalize function takes any remaining parts that have not been extracted
as other information, and pushes those fields into a generic `regions` field.

#### Address#split

Split the address into it's component parts, and remove any empty parts

#### Address#toString

Convert the address to a string representation
